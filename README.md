I created this with the aim of learning React and Typescript, so contributions are welcome.

Demo: https://djuretic.github.io/cotw_editor/

## Instructions

Node version I'm using: 10.21.0

```
git clone https://github.com/djuretic/cotw_editor.git
cd cotw_editor

And then open index.html in your browser, or use `npm run serve` instead.
